## Python Piscine

A progressive, hands-on path to learn Python by building small, focused projects.
Each module introduces one core concept and builds on the previous — encouraging daily practice, iteration, and practical understanding instead of theory-only learning.

### What this repo contains

A sequence of independent mini-projects, completed in order:

* **Starting** — language basics, execution model, simple scripts
* **Array** — collections, indexing, iteration patterns
* **DataTable** — structured data manipulation
* **OOP** — classes, encapsulation, and design thinking
* **Dod** — applied concepts combining previous modules

The goal is not just to “finish exercises”, but to internalize how Python is used to model problems step-by-step.

---

### Learning approach

* Small scope → deep understanding
* Daily submissions → continuous feedback
* Incremental difficulty → cumulative knowledge
* Peer evaluation → explain to learn

You should be able to open any folder and see a single idea explored clearly.

---

### Tech

* Python 3
* Standard library only (focus on fundamentals before frameworks)

---

### How to run

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd <module_folder>
python3 main.py
```

### Why this project exists

Most tutorials teach *syntax*.
This teaches *thinking in Python*:

break problems → model data → design behavior → refine structure.

By the end, you’re not memorizing Python — you’re using it naturally.
